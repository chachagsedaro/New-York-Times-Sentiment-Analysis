# New-York-Times-Sentiment-Analysis
This is a simple jupyter notebook to do NLP sentiment analysis over any time period of articles from The New York Times. For this, my main interest was to run sentiment analysis over The New York Times' news article headlines over the last 10 years and explore any trends. I used the New York Times Archive API and Vader sentiment analyser to do this. The caveate with this analysis is that it can't really account for subjective vs objective headlines.

Key Findings:

The total number of articles being published by The New York times seems to be dropping year over year

Discernible difference and trend between among negative and posiive article headlines

Key spikes during the 2020-2021 a.k.a. peak covid pandemic years
